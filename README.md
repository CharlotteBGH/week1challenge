# Week 1 Challenge: Refactoring the Horiseon website
## Description
The purpose of these changes was to make the website more accessible to meet accessibility standards (e.g. for people using screen-readers) and optimise it for SEO. This included inserting semantic HTML elements in a logical structure, adding ALT attributes to image and icon elements, sequentially reordering heading attributes, and adding descriptive title elements. 
## Usage
To see the ALT text, use a screen-reader. You can also view the HTML by right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect'.
